John had always been the quiet one in their small coastal town. With her short, tousled hair and a fondness for leather jackets, she spent most of her days tending to her flower shop, "Wild Blooms." Her flowers were as bold as she was—sunflowers, deep red roses, and lilies that seemed to glow in the sunlight.

Amy, on the other hand, was a whirlwind of energy. She had a soft laugh that carried over the ocean breeze and an endless supply of colorful scarves she wrapped around her neck, even in the summer. She worked as a librarian and spent her free time sketching at the café across from John’s shop.

John noticed Amy long before Amy noticed her. Every morning, as Amy passed the flower shop on her way to work, John would peek from behind a row of daisies, her heart flipping at Amy’s carefree smile.

One rainy afternoon, fate intervened. Amy burst into John’s shop, soaked and out of breath.

“Hi! Sorry—caught in the rain. Can I wait here for a bit?” Amy asked, water dripping from her scarf onto the floor.

John froze for a moment before snapping out of it. “Of course! Let me grab you a towel,” she said, disappearing into the back.

When she returned, Amy was inspecting a small pot of daisies. “These are my favorite,” Amy said softly.

John grinned, her nerves fading. “Mine too. They’re simple, but they always seem so… happy.”

They talked as the rain poured outside. Amy asked about the flowers, and John shared stories about where she found her inspiration. Amy, in turn, revealed her passion for sketching and how she often drew the flowers in John’s window.

When the rain stopped, Amy hesitated at the door. “Thank you for letting me hide out. I owe you one,” she said with a shy smile.

John, heart pounding, took a chance. “How about dinner? You can call it paying me back.”

Amy’s cheeks flushed as she nodded. “I’d like that.”

From that day on, the flower shop became Amy’s favorite stop—not just for daisies, but for John. Over time, their love grew like the flowers in the shop, strong and vibrant.

And every now and then, when it rained, they’d sit by the window, sharing a cup of tea, grateful for the storm that brought them together.
